# Search

Your search queries will reveal a lot about you. Even if we assume Google is only using them for their own purposes, and not providing them to third parties, no one can say if a data leak won't happen to Google in the future.

## Using the site directly

If you remember that the thing you're looking for is specifically on a specific website, and that website has its own search functionality (like Wikipedia, Reddit, Twitter or Stack Overflow), you can use its own search feature instead of writing e.g. `something something reddit` to Google. This of course doesn't work if the site does not offer this, or its search feature is broken (Tumblr), or its own search feature delegates to Google (TVTropes)

## Bing

This option switches your data collector from Google to Microsoft. Since MS is just as guilty in privacy violation practices, I don't recommend this one. 

## StartPage

This option isn't a search engine by itself, rather, it forwards queries to Google on your behalf, so Google itself doesn't know who's connecting.

## DuckDuckGo

DuckDuckGo promises to not store your queries and not store any identifying information. It aggregates data from multiple sources, including Bing, Yahoo. It handles IT-related queries very well in my experience, sometimes doing it better than Google.

This is more of a toy currently. It's a decentralized search engine where everyone can contribute to indexing by having their own server, joining the global effort of indexing the web.

## SauceNAO

Works pretty well for searching source of art, manga pages or anime screenshots. I have not tested it with other stuff, but should generally work. Does not handle cropped images well.
