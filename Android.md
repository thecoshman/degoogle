## Android

Ah, the legendary security Swiss cheese and also your worst privacy nightmare. Blame shitty phone manufacturers that assume that all phones will be thrown away after two years after the phone's premiere on the market. 

Your situation is directly dependent on your smartphone model, if it's popular enough, it's more likely to have the firmware opensourced or at the very least freely available from the manufacturer's website.

# Phones

As of 2017 the best support ever is provided by the Google Nexus series because you can directly get the source code from AOSP, compile it, deploy it and you'll have a working phone. This implies all the alternative OSes are first implemented on the Nexus series, and then possibly on the other ones. Samsung Galaxy S series is likely to have custom ROMs/alternative OSes because it's popular. OnePlus series used to push for community support by using CyanogenMod by default so they're also likely to have custom ROMs.

# Getting rid of bloat

- Rooting
- Bootloader unlock
- Installing alternative ROMs

# LineageOS

This is what CyanogenMod is called now, it's a fork. It's also most likely candidate as an alternative to your stock ROM. As a side effect of legal fights with Google it doesn't include any of the closed source Google applications, which is a good thing for us. It has the highest chance of working with your phone.

# Replicant

Open source-only distro of Android, which means it has even less chance of working on your device than LineageOS.

# App repositiories

Since Google Play relies on Google Play Services a.k.a. all the Google stuff we want to avoid, we won't be able to use it, or at least, not directly through the Google Play apk. You may want to use alternative app repositories:

- F-Droid. Hosts open source applications only, and is transparent about unwanted features in apps. 
- Aptoide. Likely to have a ton of **unofficially** republished applications from Google Play. Trust them at your own risk.

# Sailfish OS

Actual standalone not-Android, not-WP, not-iOS operating system. The company behind it also sells phones with it preinstalled.

# Neo900

A crowdfounded project that involves replacing the existing innards of old Nokias N900 and replacing them with more modern, mostly open source components. http://neo900.org/

# Purism Librem 5

A company that already produced privacy-oriented notebooks before is releasing a phone with a non-Android OS. https://puri.sm/shop/librem-5/
