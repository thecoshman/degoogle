# The Web Browser

Obviously the Internet is a very hard tool to use these days without a web browser. 
Seems like one of the first things to replace when detaching form Google then would be their own browser, Chrome/Chromium.
In theory, Chromium is a brandless version of Chrome, without any of the Google tracking; colour me skeptical.

There are some options here, Opera probably being the only other main alternative, but I'm currently going with FireFox.
Nothing against Opera really, I used to use it (way back before Chrome) but FF is going to soon get a stable update to support *lots* of tabs (57 if I'm not mistaken);
I use wuite a few tabs, it scares some people.
Out of the box, FF also comes with a nice set of options to help detach from Google.

## Web Search

You have to give credit where it's due, Google have a damn fine search engine.
But they are just one option. 
DuckDuckGo is a solid alterntive and offers a trackerless service.
I'm currently going with it as a my main serach engine.
Sure, I often find the results may not be what I want, but it's very easy to swap to other search egines, thanks to...

### 'Bang Search'

I think this is a feature the DDG started; basically, using short syntax like `!g` to automatically redirect your search query to Googles engine.
Antoher example is `!w` to search Wikipedia.
Chrome and FF can configure custom serach engines with 'key words' of your own choosing.
I've used this patern for a while now, it's nice to see that FF supports it, and I just need to configure the browser with the serach engines I want.

## Privacy Plugins

There is actually a nice pack of privacy plugins from Mozilla them selves, definately [worth a look](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/collections/mozilla/privacy/).
This project isn't really aimed at privacy specifixally, more at detaching from Google, but this is a nice addition;
and part of using the web these days is aadly also trying to stop and endless onsalught of companies tracking you, Google being perhaps the biggest offender.
