# YouTube

This is a major problem because there's a lot of alternatives, but there's also none: if the person uploads the content you like only to YouTube, you're out of luck. Fortunately, there's a lot of problems with YouTube that even people not concerned with privacy notice, causing them to look for alternatives.

# Alternative services
