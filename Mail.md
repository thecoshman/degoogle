# Email replacements

Back when first introduced in 2006, GMail was a revolution amongst free email providers thanks to it having 1GB of storage, putting other services which provided 50MB-100MB way back behind. 

## ProtonMail

I've (milleniumbug) decided to use ProtonMail after it was recently opened up to everyone without need for invitations. It provides paid and free accounts, the latter are subject to limitations: 500MB storage, mandatory "sent from ProtonMail" footer. 

## Temporary email accounts

For signing up for services, it's not necessary to own a permanent email account, there are some services which provide a temporary email account. Note that a service registeration form may reject domains that indicate a temporary email address. It just means you should try a more obscure service which the authors of that service aren't familiar with.

- https://www.guerrillamail.com/ - my (milleniumbug) personal favourite: seems to be a most robust one, with multiple domains, and a randomly generated email address, which reduces the chance of someone reusing your address and issuing a "forgot password" request.
- https://www.mailinator.com/ - probably the most known temporary email service, it provides the minimum functionality.

## Hosting your own

Not recommended, due to huge administration costs. It will be your responsibility to clear yourself out of other's banlists (you'll waste your time IOW you'll waste your money).
