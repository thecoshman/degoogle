# Email replacements

Back when first introduced in 2006, GMail was a revolution amongst free email providers thanks to it having 1GB of storage, putting other services which provided 50MB-100MB way back behind. 

## ProtonMail

I've (milleniumbug) decided to use ProtonMail after it was recently opened up to everyone without need for invitations. It provides paid and free accounts, the latter are subject to limitations: 500MB storage, mandatory "sent from ProtonMail" footer. 

## Temporary email accounts

For signing up for services, it's not necessary to own a permanent email account, there are some services which provide a temporary email account

## Hosting your own

Not recommended, due to huge administration costs. It will be your responsibility to clear yourself out of other's banlists (you'll waste your time IOW you'll waste your money).
